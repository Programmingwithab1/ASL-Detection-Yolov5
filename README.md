# ASL-Detection-Yolov5
We have come up with a real-time method using the YoloV5 Model for fingerspelling-based American sign language. In our method, the hand sign is detected by the camera, then passes through the model and predicts the class of the hand gestures. Our method provides 98.5 % accuracy for the 26 letters of the alphabet.
